UPLOADED FILES:

1. CSS :  This folder contains the Cascading Style Sheets for the entire project named under player.css **BOOTSTRAPPING NOT IMPLEMENTED!**
2. PHP_HTML:  This folder contains a README file that explains the each file content. **FILE CONTAINS HARD CODED IMPLEMENTATION**
3. Javascript: This folder contains the functionality of the music player that plays the song from a folder stored in the database.


ISSUES AND REQUIREMENT:

1. **THIS IS HARDCODED PROJECT** , so the implementation file contains the respective CSS,PHP and HTML codes all in the same file.
2. For playing the song **MAKE SURE** that you have Javascript Enabled in your localhost.
3. The **database name, server name, username,password**  all vary depending on your localhost in **your INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM**. **SO DON'T COPY BLINDLY**


This is an attempt made for **learning purposes** as part of our **Academic Syllabus 4th Semester Database Management Systems Course.**



**HAPPY CODING!!!**
